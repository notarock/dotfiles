# My neglected dotfile repository, now with even more breakage!

This repository contains all of my configurations for doom-emacs,
stumpwm/herbstluftwm/whatever DE/WM I am using at the moment, and
many more. It is all managed by Nix, mostly home-manager. You will find a
"macos" branch with the most up-to-date changes. This is simply because I am
lazy and never merged the two system configurations properly...
